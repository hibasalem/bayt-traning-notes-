# TCL introduction & tutorials

Tool Command Language , a string based scripting language. commonly used for rapid prototyping, scripted applications, GUIs, and testing.

- start the interactive session with the `tclsh` command. The prompt changes to the `%` character

- Tcl **_comments_** start with the `#` character.

- **_White space_** is used to separate words in Tcl source

- In Tcl, **_0 is false_** and **_any nonzero value is true_**.

---

## commands

A Tcl script consists of **_commands_**, separated by newlines or semicolons. followed by one or more words which are its arguments. Each argument is separated by white space. `command arg1 arg2 arg3`

`expr` command is used to perform arithmetic calculations

Variables in Tcl are created with the `set` command.

`puts`, `open`, `gets`, `flush`, `incr`, `info`, `set`, and `unset`

- `puts` command is used to **_print messages_** to the console or to other channels like a file.

- `puts ?-nonewline? ?channelId? string`

  Optional parameters are specified between question marks.

  - The `-nonewline` switch suppresses the newline character. By default, the command puts a newline to each message.
  - The channelId must be an identifier for an open channel , defaults to standard output channel stdout

- The `open` command opens a file, a serial port, or a command pipeline and returns a channel identifier

- The `gets` command reads a line from a channel, and the `flush` command flushes buffered output of a channel

- The `incr` increments the value of a variable  
  `incr varName ?increment?`
  If a parameter is passed to the command, then its value is added to the value of the variable; otherwise the value is incremented by 1.

- The `info` command returns information about the state of the Tcl interpreter.
  examples  
  `puts [info tclversion]` print the version of the Tcl interpreter  
  `puts [info host]` prints the host name  
  `puts [info exists var]` check if the variable var is set

- The `set` command is used to create and read variables. The `unset` command destroys a variable.

- Command line arguments , Tcl has three predefined variables.

  - `$argc` - the number of arguments passed to the script
  - `$argv` - the list of arguments
  - `$argv0` - the name of the script

## Substitution

Square brackets are used for command substitution.

There are three kinds of substitutions in Tcl.

- Command substitution
- Variable substitution
- Backslash substitution

If a word contains a dollar sign `$`, then Tcl performs **_variable substitution_** (The dollar-sign and the following characters are replaced in the word by the value of a variable.)

the **_backslash substitution_**, we escape the original meaning of the character. For example, the `\n` stands for a **_new line_** and the `\t` is the **_tab character_** , `\b` is substituted with a **_backspace_**.

---

- **_Braces_** can be used instead of double quotes to set strings separated by a white space.
  substitution of words is disabled inside braces.(Everything is printed literally)

- also **_Braces_** are used to **_create lists_**

- **_Square brackets_**, [], are used to create nested commands.(nested commands are executed before the main command)

- **_Double quotes_** group words as a single argument to commands.( Commands , Dollar signs, square brackets, and the backslash are interpreted inside quotes)

- **_Round brackets_** are used to indicate an array subscript or to change the precedence of operators for the expr command.

---

## Backslash

The backslash character can be used in three different ways

- for special characters (escape sequences) (newlines, tabs, backspaces ......)
- escapes the meaning of special Tcl characters (`$, {}, "", \, ()`)
- a line continuation character.

## Expressions

In Tcl language the expressions are not built into the core language , it is evaluated with the `expr` command.

- operators used in the Tcl language

![operators used in the Tcl language](./imgs/08.JPG)

- There is also one **_ternary operator_** `?:`, which works with three operands. `cond-exp ? exp1 : exp2`


- and the **_Boolean operators_** (logical) ( && , || , ! )

- **_Relational operators_** comparison operators. ( < , <= , > , >= , == , != 0)

- **_Bitwise operators_**

- **_The expansion operator_** `{*}`, makes each item in a list an individual argument of the current command.
