# what is design patterns

**_Design patterns are programming language independent strategies for solving a common problem_**. That means a design pattern represents an **_idea_**, not a particular implementation.

A design pattern provides a general **_reusable solution_** (flexible, reusable, and maintainable) for the common problems that occur in software design 

The pattern typically shows relationships and interactions between classes or objects.

The idea is to ***speed up*** the development process by providing well-tested, proven development/design paradigms

# MVC Design Pattern

Model-View-Controller

allows us to construct 3-tier applications, allowing us useful layers of separation in our code , it helps in enhancing our ability to maintain and expand on existing applications.

- **_views_** : the UI ( basically the end result which we send to a web browser)

- **_Model_** : application logic (business layer). transform raw data into data which contains some sort of meaning, which is then delivered to the View for display , usually encapsulate database queries, perhaps taking advantage of an abstract database class (a data access layer)

- **_Controller_** :
  - the first point of call for any incoming HTTP requests in a web application
  - examines what it received in the request
  - The most common use is something like a switch() statement in your index file
  - the component which triggers the binding of data from the Model to elements in the View.

# Understanding Basics of UI Design Pattern MVC, MVP and MVVM

Why we need UI design pattern for our application?

- In traditional UI development having the logical code in the view increased the size of the view class and created a very strong dependency between the UI and data binding logic and business operations.

- no two developers can work simultaneously on the same view and also one developer's changes might break the other code

these problems exist because there is a very tight coupling between the
(View (UI) Model (Data displayed in UI) Glue code (Event handling, binding, business logic))

Glue code is different in each pattern , in **_MVC_** it is controller. In case of **_MVP_** it is presenter. In case of **_MVVM_** it is view model.

- the point is **_â€œSeparation of Duties"_** , patterns allow us to develop applications with loss coupling and separation of concern which in turn improve testability, maintainability and extendibility with minimum effort.

- **_MVC_**, the Controller is responsible for determining which View is displayed in response to any action including when the application loads. (every action in the View basically calls to a Controller along with an action) , The view simply renders, and is completely stateless.

- **_MVP_**, view binds to the Model directly through data binding , the Presenter's pass the Model to the View so that it can bind to it , The Presenter will also contain logic for gestures like pressing a button, navigation.

- **_MVVM (Model View ViewModel)_** , the ViewModel (Agent or middle man between view and model) acts as an interface between model and View , provides data binding between View and model data , handles all UI actions by using command

ViewModel does not need a reference to a view. The view binds its control value to properties on a ViewModel, which exposes data contained in model objects.

# Software Design Patterns: A Guide

design patterns, split into three basic categories: **_Creational_**, **_Structural_**, and **_Behavioral_**

## Creational Patterns

emphasize the automatic creation of objects within code, rather than requiring you to instantiate objects directly. (what that means is a function or method can call the code necessary to instantiate new objects so you only need to explicitly modify that object creation when it is necessary)

(Abstract Factory , Builder ,Factory , Prototype ,Singleton)

## Structural patterns

focus on the composition of classes and objects. By using `inheritance` and `interfaces` (abstract type or class which has no logical code , instead uses to define method signatures and behaviors for other classes that will implement the interface),

these patterns allow objects to be composed in a manner that provides new functionality.

(Adapter ,Bridge , Composite , Decorator , Facade , Flyweight ,Proxy )

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with communication and assignment between objects.

(Chain of Responsibility , Command , Interpreter , Iterator , Mediator , Memento , Observer , State , Strategy , Template , Visitor)
