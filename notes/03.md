# Tailwind

Tailwind UI is a collection of professionally designed, pre-built, fully responsive HTML snippets you can drop into your Tailwind projects.

## geting started

in the repo

- `npm init -y`
- `npm install tailwindcss postcss postcss-cli autoprefixer`
- `npx tailwindcss init -p` (This creates the tailwind.config.js
  ( for autocomplete) , -p ensures that the postcss.config.js file is created at the same time)

- create the files

  - tailwind.css
  - Folder “dist/css” (everything goes together in VSC!)
  - A file “styles.css”
  - A file index.html in /dist/

- in tailwind.css:

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

- In the /package.json

```
"scripts": {
    "build": "postcss tailwind.css -o dist/css/styles.css",
    "watch": "postcss tailwind.css -o dist/css/styles.css --watch"
},
```

- Compile the CSS
  `npm run build` or `npm run watch `

- Shrink CSS with Purgecss
  at the end of work , clean any unused style

  - npm install @fullhuman/postcss-purgecss

  - In the end you get purgecss to work with the following lines in tailwind.config.js :

    ```
    purge: {
    enabled: true,
    content: ['./dist/**/*.html'],
    },

    ```

if we want to edit we should set enable back to false

cheatsheet

The `@layer base` means that our definitions in the compiled stylesheets are inserted at the end of the base styles.

in the the tailwind.css:
example , for the the h1 in the project

```
@layer base {
    h1 {
    @apply text-5xl;
    }
}
```

**_new font_**

in tailwind.css

```
@font-face {
    font-family: name;
    src: url(/filelocation/name.ttf) format(" truetype ");
}
```

Extend the Tailwindcss theme
In the tailwind.config.js we add under “ theme ” and “ extend ”:

```
theme: {
    extend: {
    fontFamily: {
        headline: ['Oswald']
    }
},

```

The name “headline” can be chosen freely here!

last step

````

h1 {
    @apply text-5xl font-headline ;
}

```
````

**_my own color_**

In the tailwind.config.js we add under “ theme ” and “ extend ”:

```
colors : {
    mainColor: '#212f49'
}
```

---

Outsourcing theme

the outsourced file is imported again via presets:[ ... ],

example:

```
 presets: [
 require('./company_styles')
 ],
```

To deactivate a feature, set the property within “ corePlugins ” in tailwind.config.js to false .
If “corePlugins” does not yet exist, it must be created first. Example:

```
corePlugins : {
float : false
}
```
