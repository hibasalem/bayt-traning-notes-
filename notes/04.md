cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive

Variables in JavaScript are "hoisted" (or "lifted") to the top of the function or statement

- let and const are hoisted but not initialized.

data types

- Seven data types that are **_primitives_**:
- Boolean. true and false.
  - null.
  - undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined.
  - Number. An integer or floating point number
  - BigInt. An integer with arbitrary precision
  - String. A sequence of characters that represent a text value
  - Symbol A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.
- and **_Object_**

- JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.( no specify of the variable data typeon declaation. also data types are automatically converted as-needed during script execution)

- Falsy values : (false, undefined, null, 0, NaN, empty string (""))

- The `for...in` statement iterates a specified variable over all the enumerable properties of an object.

- The `for...of` statement creates a loop Iterating over iterable objects (including Array, Map, Set, arguments object and so on), invoking a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property.

- You may nest a function within another function. The nested (inner) function is private to its containing (outer) function.

A `Map` object is a simple key/value map and can iterate its elements in insertion order.

- `Objects` allow you to set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key. `Map` objects **_have a few more advantages_** that make them better maps.

  - The keys of an Object are Strings or Symbols, where they can be of any value for a Map.
  - You can get the size of a Map easily, while you have to manually keep track of size for an Object.
  - The iteration of maps is in insertion order of the elements.
  - An Object has a prototype, so there are default keys in the map. (This can be bypassed using map = Object.create(null).)

whether to use a Map or an Object:

- use maps over objects when keys are unknown until run time, and when all keys are the same type and all values are the same type.
- Use maps if there is a need to store primitive values as keys because object treats each key as a string whether it's a number value, boolean value or any other primitive value.
- Use objects when there is logic that operates on individual elements.

- `Set objects` are collections of values. You can iterate its elements in insertion order. A value in a Set may only occur once; it is unique in the Set's collection.

- You can create an Array from a Set using `Array.from` or the spread syntax.

there are three native ways to list/traverse object properties:

- `for...in` loops This method traverses all enumerable properties of an object and its prototype chain.
- `Object.keys(o)` This method returns an array with all the own (not in the prototype chain) enumerable properties' names ("keys") of an object o.
- `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(o)` This method returns an array containing all own properties' names (enumerable or not) of an object o.

JavaScript is an object-based language based on prototypes, rather than being class-based.

### Class-based vs. prototype-based languages

- **_Class-based object-oriented languages_**, such as Java and C++, are founded on the concept of two distinct entities: classes ( defines all of the properties that characterize a certain set of objects) and instances (the instantiation of a class).

- **_A prototype-based language_**, such as JavaScript, does not make this distinction: it has objects. A prototype-based language has the notion of a prototypical object, an object used as a template from which to get the initial properties for a new object.

- **_In class-based languages_**, you define a class in a separate **_class definition_**. In that definition you can specify special methods, called constructors, to create instances of the class. A **_constructor method_** can specify initial values for the instance's properties and perform other processing appropriate at creation time.

- JavaScript follows a similar model, but does not have a class definition separate from the constructor. Instead, you define a **_constructor function_** to create objects with a particular initial set of properties and values. Any JavaScript function can be used as a constructor.

- In a class-based language, you create a hierarchy of classes through the class definitions

- JavaScript implements inheritance by allowing you to associate a prototypical object with any constructor function.

A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Since most people are consumers of already-created promises

- Callbacks added with then() will never be invoked before the completion of the current run of the JavaScript event loop.
- Multiple callbacks may be added by calling then() several times.
- It's possible to chain after catch, which is useful to accomplish new actions even after an action failed in the chain

An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is permitted within them. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.

- `Promise.resolve()` and `Promise.reject()` are shortcuts to manually create an already resolved or rejected promise respectively. This can be useful at times.

- `Promise.all()` and `Promise.race()` are two composition tools for running asynchronous operations in parallel.

Meta programming a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat other programs as their data.

ECMAScript 6, `Proxy` objects allow you to intercept certain operations and to implement custom behaviors.
The Proxy object enables you to create a proxy for another object, which can intercept and redefine fundamental operations for that object.
A Proxy is created with two parameters:

- target: the original object which you want to proxy
- handler: an object that defines which operations will be intercepted and how to redefine intercepted operations.

`Reflect` is a built-in object that provides methods for interceptable JavaScript operations. The methods are the same as those of the proxy handlers.

Reflect is not a function object.
Reflect helps with forwarding default operations from the handler to the target.
