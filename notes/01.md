## Layers of OSI Model

resours [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/layers-of-osi-model/)

> osi : **_Open Systems Interconnection_** , a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system .

It has a 7 layer architecture (software layers , transport , hardware layers) that work collaboratively to **_transmit the data from one person to another_**

OSI model acts as a reference model and is not implemented on the Internet because of its late invention. The current model being used is the TCP/IP model.

### 1. Physical Layer

- devices : Hub, Repeater, Modem, Cables
- responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices.
- contains information in the form of **_bits_**
- **_transmitting_** individual bits from one node to the next.
- get the signal received and convert it into 0s and 1s and **_send them to the Data Link layer_**

**_The functions :_**

- Bit **_synchronization_**: providing a **_clock_**. This clock controls sender and receiver providing synchronization at bit level

- Bit **_rate control_**: defines the transmission rate (bits sent per second )

- Physical **_topologies_** : specifies the arrangement ofthe devices/nodes in a network (star , mesh ...)

- **_Transmission mode_** : defines the way in which the data flows between the two connected devices ( Simplex, half-duplex and full-duplex)

### 2. Data Link Layer (DLL)

- devices : Switch & Bridge
- responsible for the node-to-node delivery of the message (make sure data transfer is error-free )
- transmit arrived packet to the Host using its MAC address.

> ( The **_packet received_** from the Network ,
> **_divided into frames_** depending on NIC(Network Interface Card) , encapsulates Sender and Receiver’s MAC address ,
> The Receiver’s **_MAC address is obtained by placing an ARP request_**( Address Resolution Protocol) onto the wire asking “Who has that IP address?” and **_the destination host will reply with its MAC address_**.
> )

Data Link Layer is divided into two sublayers:

- Logical Link Control (LLC)

- Media Access Control (MAC)

**_The functions :_**

- **_Framing_** : provides a way for a sender to transmit a set of bits that are meaningful to the receiver ( attaching special bit patterns to the beginning and end of the frame)

- **_Physical addressing_**: adding physical addresses (sender and receiver MAC address) in the header of each frame.

- **_Error control_**: detects and retransmits damaged or lost frames.

- **_Flow Control_**: coordinates the amount of data that can be sent before receiving acknowledgement.

- **_Access control_**: MAC( sub-layer ) helps to determine which device has control over the channel at a given time.

### 3. Network Layer

- devices : routers
- works for the **_transmission of data_** from one host to the other located in different networks
- takes care of **_packet routing_** (selection of the shortest path to transmit the packet)
- place sender & receiver’s **_IP addresses_** in the header

**_The functions :_**

- Routing : determine which route is suitable from source to destination.
- Logical Addressing : defines an addressing scheme (to identify each device on internetwork uniquely ) ( IP addresses are placed in the header )

### 4. Transport Layer

- Heart of OSI model

- **_provides services_** to the application layer and takes services from the network layer.

- data is referred to as Segments

- provides the **_acknowledgement_** of the successful data transmission and **_re-transmits_** the data if an error is found.

- At **_ sender’s side_** : **_receives the formatted data_** from the upper layers, performs **_Segmentation_**, and also **implements Flow & Error control** to ensure proper data transmission ,also **_adds Source and Destination port numbers_** in its header and **_forwards the segmented data_**

- At **_ receiver’s side_**: **_reads the port number_** from its header and **_forwards the Data_** to the respective application

**_The functions :_**

- **_Segmentation and Reassembly_** : accepts the message from the session layer , breaks the message into smaller units each has a header, transport layer at the destination station reassembles the message

- **_Service Point Addressing_** : includes service point address or port address (to deliver the message to the correct process)

**_The services :_**

- Connection-Oriented Service: (Connection Establishment, Data Transfer ,Termination / disconnection) transmission is reliable and secure , the receiving device sends an acknowledgement back to the source .

- Connectionless service : Data Transfer . the receiver does not acknowledge receipt of a packet , much **_faster communication_** between devices

### 5. Session Layer

- (Session Layer , Presentation Layer , Application Layer) are integrated as a single layer in the TCP/IP model as “Application Layer” ,Upper Layers or Software Layers

- responsible for the establishment of connection , maintenance of sessions, authentication, and also ensures security

**_The functions :_**

- Session establishment, maintenance, and termination
- Synchronization : add checkpoints which are considered synchronization which helps to identify the error so that the data is re-synchronized properly and data loss is avoided
- Dialog Controller: allows two systems to start communication in half-duplex or full-duplex.

### 6. Presentation Layer

- called the Translation layer
- The data is extracted here and manipulated as per the required format to transmit over the network.

**_The functions :_**

- Translation: For example, ASCII to EBCDIC(an 8-bit character encoding for numeric and alphanumeric characters. symbols, letters and numbers are presented in binary language).
- Encryption/ Decryption: translates the data into another form or code. (**_ encrypted data is ciphertext_** and **_decrypted data is plain text_**.) A **_key value_** is used for encrypting and decrypting data.
- Compression: Reduces the number of bits that need to be transmitted .

### 7. Application Layer

- also called Desktop Layer
- Applications Browsers ....
- its implemented by the network applications.whichproduce the data, which has to be transferred over the network
- also serves as a window for the application services to access the network and displaying the received information to the user.

**_The functions :_**

- Network Virtual Terminal
- FTAM-File transfer access and management
- Mail Services
- Directory Services

## How the browser renders a web page? — DOM, CSSOM, and Rendering

resours [article](https://medium.com/jspoint/how-the-browser-renders-a-web-page-dom-cssom-and-rendering-df10531c9969)

- The browser blocks some rendering of a webpage until certain resources are loaded first while other resources are loaded asynchronously.

the lifecycle of how a browser renders a typical webpage

- when browser sends a **_request_** to a server to fetch an HTML document, the server **_returns an HTML page in binary stream format _** ( text file with the response header `Content-Type` set to the value `text/html;charset=UTF-8`. )  
  `text/html` is a **_MIME Type_** (tells the browser that it is an HTML document )  
  `charset=UTF-8 `tells the browser that it is encoded in UTF-8 character encoding

### Document Object Model (DOM)

- When the browser reads HTML code and find HTML element it creates a JavaScript object called a **_Node_** , **_all HTML elements will be converted to JavaScript objects_**

- the Node object will be created from different classes (constructor ) for each element (it also inherits Node class)(The browser comes with built-in classes like HTMLDivElement, HTMLScriptElement, Node ...) .

- then it has to create a tree-like structure (**_DOM tree_**) of these node objects. (When the browser creates a DOM tree, it also saves things like comments, attributes, text as separate nodes in the tree.)

JavaScript doesn’t understand what DOM is, **_DOM is a high-level Web API_** provided by the browser to efficiently render a webpage and expose it publically for the developer to dynamically manipulate DOM elements for various purposes.

### CSS Object Model (CSSOM)

- After constructing the DOM, the browser reads CSS from all the sources (external, embedded, inline, user-agent ( the browser comes with its own stylesheet), ...) and construct a CSSOM.

- CSSOM Tree Like structure just like DOM. Each node in this tree contains CSS style information that will be applied to DOM elements that it target

- the browser first computes final CSS properties for DOM element by overriding user agent styles with CSS provided by the developer properties (using specificity rules) and then construct a node. if there is no rules it set to the default value .

- CSSOM tree does not contain elements which do not get printed on the screen like `<link> <title> <script>`

### Render Tree

- a tree-like structure constructed by **_combining DOM and CSSOM_** trees together

- a low-level representation of what will eventually get printed on the screen (it won’t contain nodes that do not hold any area in the pixel matrix)

- CSSOM is kept **_hidden from the user_**. but the browser exposes the CSSOM node of a DOM element by providing high-level API on the DOM element itself.

### Rendering Sequence

1. **_Layout operation_** (reflow or browser reflow ) : giving the size for each node in pixels and where (position) it will be printed on the screen.(the browser is calculating the layout information of each node.)

- We should avoid the webpage going through multiple layout operations for minuscule reasons since it is a **_costly operation_**

events that can trigger the layout/reflow of the elements :

- insert, remove or update an element in the DOM
- modify content on the page, e.g. the text in an input box
- move a DOM element
- animate a DOM element
- take measurements of an element such as offsetHeight or getComputedStyle
- change a CSS style
- change the className of an element
- add or remove a stylesheet
- resize the window
- scroll

2. **_Paint operation (rasterization)_**

- when we have layers, we can combine them and draw them on the screen. But the browser does not draw all the layers in a single go. Each layer is drawn separately first.

- Inside each layer, the browser fills the individual pixels for whatever visible property the element has (**_rasterization_**) , To increase performance, the browser may use different threads to perform rasterization.

- Rasterization is normally done in CPU which makes it slow and expensive, but we now have new techniques to do it in GPU for performance enhancement.

3. **_Compositing operation_**

- What we have now are different layers (bitmap images) that should be drawn on the screen in a specific order , in **_compositing operations_**, these layers are sent to GPU to finally draw it on the screen.

This sequence of events is also called **_critical rendering path_**.
![critical rendering path](https://miro.medium.com/max/1250/1*yQJkz12sPxS-kJoMDqzbEQ.png)

### Browser engines , Rendering Process in browsers

- the critical rendering path is done throw Browser engines (Rendering Engine or Layout Engine , WebKit for safari Blink for chrome )

- HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, these languages are standardized by some entity or some organization. However, **_how a browser manages them together to render things on the screen is not standardized_**.

Despite these inconsistencies, there are some common principles that are usually the same among all browsers.

1. Parsing and External Resources

- **_Parsing_** is the process of reading HTML content and constructing a DOM tree from it (DOM parsing and the program that does that is called the DOM parser.)
- Most browsers provide the DOMParser Web API to construct a DOM tree from the HTML code

- the browser can build the DOM tree incrementally, one node at a time. The browser parses HTML from top to bottom since the HTML represents a nested tree-like structure.

**_performance metrics_**

- **_FP_** `First Paint` : the time at which the browser has started printing things on the screen (background color , ...)

- **_FCP_** `First Contentful Paint` which means the time at which the browser has rendered the first pixel of the content ( text or image , ...)

- **_LCP_** `Largest Contentful Paint` which means the time at which the browser has rendered large pieces of text or image.

- **_L_** `onload event` which is emitted by the browser on the window object.

- **_DCL_** `DOMContentLoaded` event which is emitted on the document object but it bubbles up to window

Whenever the browser encounters an external resource ( image , script link ... ) , the browser will start the download of that file in the background (away from the main thread of the JavaScript execution)

- the DOM parsing normally happens on the main thread.

- So if the main JavaScript execution thread is busy, DOM parsing will not progress until the thread is free. (script elements are parser-blocking)

### Parser-Blocking Scripts

a script (JavaScript) file/code that stops the parsing of the HTML. When the browser encounters a script element, if it an embedded script, then it will execute that script first and then continue parsing the HTML to construct the DOM tree.

- The browser exposes DOM API to the JavaScript runtime, which means we can access and manipulate DOM elements from the JavaScript (this is how React and Angular works)

- if the browser wishes to run DOM parsing and script execution parallelly, then there could be race conditions between the DOM parser thread and the main thread which is why DOM parsing must happen on the main thread.(totally unnecessary in most cases HTML5 gives us the async attribute for the script tag )

- also `defer` attribute for the script element which works similar to the async attribute but the script doesn’t execute even when the file is fully downloaded. All defer scripts are executed once the parser has parsed all HTML

- all async scripts do not block parser **_until they are downloaded_**. As soon as an async script is downloaded, it becomes parser-blocking. However, all defer scripts are **_non-parser-blocking_**

### Render-Blocking CSS

- CSS (including embedded) doesn’t block the DOM parserdirectly but CSS can block DOM parsing

- DOM tree generation is incremental , CSSOM tree construction is not incremental and must happen in a specific manner.

- When browser find **_`<style>`_** block, it will parse all the embedded CSS and update the CSSOM tree with new CSS (style) rules. After that, it will continue parsing the HTML in the normal manner. The same goes for **_inline_** styling

- an **_external stylesheet_** file is not parser-blocking resources, hence the browser can download it in the background silently and the DOM parsing will continue. **_but_** the browser won’t process the stylesheet file content one byte at a time , (The reason for that is, a CSS rule at the end of the file might override a CSS rule written at the top of the file )

- if the browser starts constructing CSSOM incrementally as it parses the stylesheet content, it will lead to multiple renders of the Render Tree as the same CSSOM nodes are getting updated because of the style overrides rules that appear later in the stylesheet file. It would be an unpleasant user experience , **_thats why CSS is a render-blocking resource_**.

- Once the browser makes a request to fetch an external stylesheet, the Render Tree construction is halted. However, the DOM tree construction is still undergoing while the stylesheet is being downloaded in the background.

- A browser could have used an older state of the CSSOM tree to generate Render Tree as HTML but this would lead to **_Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC)_** which is is very bad for UX.

- When a stylesheet blocks the execution of a script, it is called a **_script-blocking stylesheet_** or a **_script-blocking CSS_**.

Like async or defer attribute makes script element non-parser-blocking, an external stylesheet can also be marked as non-render-blocking using the `media` attribute.

### Document’s DOMContentLoaded Event `DCL`

- a point in time when the browser has constructed a complete DOM tree from all the available HTML.

- We should optimize the DCL to be as small as possible

- If we have parser-blocking scripts, then DCL has to wait until all parser-blocking scripts are downloaded and executed.

- Things get a little complicated when stylesheets are thrown into the picture. Script-blocking stylesheet will delay the DCL

One of the **_best practices_** is to use` defer and async` tag for script element

### Window’s load event

- the window.onload event marks a point in time when external stylesheets and files are downloaded and our web application (complete) has finished downloading

---

presint

When a web page is loaded, the browser first reads the HTML text and constructs DOM Tree from it. Then it processes the CSS whether that is inline, embedded, or external CSS and constructs the CSSOM Tree from it.
After these trees are constructed, then it constructs the Render-Tree from it. Once the Render-Tree is constructed, then the browser starts the printing individual elements on the screen.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (http) : an application layer protocol , it allow web based apps to coumincate and exchange data , the messanger of the web , tcp/pi protocol.

- connectionless protocol
- can delever any sort of data as long as both computers able to read it
- stateless , every connection is handeled as the very first one

how the web works ?

- WRRC

type the url to the browser , request HTTP massage , close the conection , the server open the connection , server respose (http message) , close the connection complettly

http message contains ( start line , headers , body) it defers between the request and the respond

the request

- start line : method , uri , http version
- headers (name , value) : most importantly ( host , accept(file type) , aaccept-language(languages ) ... )
- body : --

the request

- start line : status code , http version
- headers (name , value) : most importantly (contlent length , aaccept-language(languages ) ... )

## An in-depth introduction to HTTP Caching

resours [article](https://medium.com/jspoint/how-the-browser-renders-a-web-page-dom-cssom-and-rendering-df10531c9969)

- storing the result somewhere and retrieving it as it is, for its further application.

**_browser_**

Taking the example of browser’s HTTP cache that all browsers implement, web resources are stored on the **_user’s filesystem_**. Hence further requests that will access these same resources will have them delivered instantly

- the browser is jut one piece of the caching chain. And if browsers were all of a sudden to stop caching everything,there is CDNs got

**_Content Delivery Networks (CDN)_**

(a network of servers that distributes content from an “origin” server throughout the world by caching content close to where each end user is accessing the internet via a web-enabled device.)

- that all of these servers are HTTP servers (proxy servers )

- Most modern CDNs advertise the ability to programmatically purge resources out of the CDN’s network instantly.

- The ability to configure your caching policy outside of your codebase means that people other than developers can have control on this (this can be good in terms of that it means that the performance part of your application, or at least a large part of it, can be completely factored out at the infrastructure level)

but this sollution can be expensive for large amount of resources

**_Private proxy_**

- examples Varnish, Squid, Traffic Server, or even Nginx

- these solution are free and open source
- these softwares are what CDNs are made of ( this massively decreases the chance of termination of their usage , also any hard gained knowledge about their installation, configuration and maintenance will directly be transferable )

##

- requests should go through these steps: DNS resolution , TCP (Transmission Control Protocol )handshake , SSL handshake ,Data downloading constrained by TCP flow and congestion control

- DNS resolution is the process of converting a human readable hostname such as example.com into an IP address. it could involve multiple DNS

- Then, each request must initiate a TCP connection. http needs it to be in order , thats why  TCP marks each byte of applications data with a unique identifier called a sequence number (SYN) 

those steps could lead to Round-trip time (RTT) bacoming high (the web to be slow) , thats why we could still need cashing in the future 


- many improvements have been made over the years. DNS resolutions are cached at different places, TLS handshakes results are reused , TCP connections were allowed to be persisted between multiple requests
