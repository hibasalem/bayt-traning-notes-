## 23 front-end performance engineering rules for web apps

- long-term headers expiration dates (short-term expiration prevent effective caching)
- fewer HTTP requests
- reduce the number of URL redirect
- Avoid empty SRC or HREF
- Remove duplicate JavaScript and CSS
- Make AJAX cacheable
- Avoid HTTP 404 (Not Found) error (expensive and degrades the user experience)
- Use cookie-free domains (static components are requested with cookie-free requests by creating a subdomain and hosting them there)
- Reduce cookie size ( minimizes the impact on response time)
- Minify CSS and JavaScript ( removes unnecessary characters , it improving load times)
- Remove unnecessary CSS rules
- Reduce the number of DOM elements
- Reference images in the HTML
- Use CDN
- Reduce DNS lookups
- Use GET for AJAX requests (the browser implements POST in two steps: first it sends the headers, and then it sends the data. but - GETsends the headers and the data together in most cases)
- Javascript at the bottom
- Resize images

## Super simple Gulp tutorial for beginners

Gulp is a popular build tools

what it helps with

- Compiling Sass files to CSS
- Concatenating (combining) multiple JavaScript files
- Minifying (compressing) your CSS and JavaScript files
- And automatically running the above tasks when a file change is detected

getting started :

`npm install gulp`

then

```
npm install gulp-sass  (compiles your Sass files into CSS)
npm install gulp-cssnano (minifies your CSS files)
npm install gulp-concat (combines multiple JavaScript files into one large file)
npm install gulp-uglify (minifies your JavaScript files)
```

or we can instal the cli

`npm install --global gulp-cli`

what the project tree will look like

![](./imgs/09.jpg)

- `app folder`, we have your basic JavaScript file (script.js) and your basic SCSS file (style.scss).

- `dist folder` exists only to store the final compiled JavaScript and CSS files after Gulp has processed them

- `gulpfile.js` file is where weâ€™ll configure Gulp

  ```
  var gulp = require('gulp');
  var cssnano = require('gulp-cssnano');
  var sass = require('gulp-sass');
  var concat = require('gulp-concat');
  var uglify = require('gulp-uglify');


  gulp.task('[Function Name]', function(){
  // Do stuff here
  }

  ```

  we run the Gulp task by typing in gulp [Function Name] into the command line

  These are the following tasks that we want Gulp to run:

  - Sass task

    ```
    gulp.task('sass', function(){
        return gulp.src('app/style.scss')
        .pipe(sass())
        .pipe(cssnano())
        .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/css'));
    });

    ```

  - JavaScript task

    ```
    gulp.task('js', function(){
        return gulp.src(['app/js/plugins/*.js', 'app/js/*.js'])
        .pipe(concat('all.js'))
        .pipe(uglify())
        .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));
     });

    ```

  - Watch task (to detect when SCSS or JavaScript files are changed, and re-run the tasks)

    ```
    gulp.task('watch', function(){
      gulp.watch('app/*.scss', ['sass']);
      gulp.watch('app/js/**/*.js', ['js']);
    });

    ```

  - Default task (to run all needed tasks when you type gulp into the command line)
